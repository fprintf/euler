# euler
project euler solutions (preferably in C but python and other languages acceptable when appropriate)

## Submissions
Submit solutions to me via IRC if you dont know how to find me (or who I am for that matter)
then you don't get to submit solutions :) Hint: rizon, but this isn't intended for people to submit
really

The intent of this project is to have fun and submit clear readable code and solve the project
euler problems in C (just because C is the best :))

### Solution Format
1. Statement of problem (in comments)
2. Author information if not me  (in comments)
3. Code

Example:

```
/*
 Problem -1 - Fix the formatting of this site

    I need to fix the formatting of this site badly
 please dont email about it.
*/

#include <stdio.h>

...

int main(void)
{
    ...
    return 0;
}
```
